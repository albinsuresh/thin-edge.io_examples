# Using thin-edge.io with Apama Streaming Analytics
This file describes how to get started with Streaming Analytics on a thin-edge
device using Apama Community Core Edition.

## Prerequisites

- A Raspberry Pi (minimum version 3) running Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit. 
- thin-edge.io installed to the Raspberry Pi, which can be done by following the instructions in the
[thin-edge.io installation guide](https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/blob/main/docs/src/howto-guides/002_installation.md).
- _Recommended:_ thin-edge.io configured with connection to Cumulocity IoT or Azure IoT Hub using the
[thin-edge.io connectivity instructions](https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/blob/main/docs/src/howto-guides/004_connect.md).

### Optional

These are not essential to be able to run the examples provided. If you want to
modify or extend the examples or implement a real solution with Apama and
thin-edge.io we recommend you follow the guidance on creating, configuring and
deploying a project contained within this document.

- A full installation of [Apama Community Edition](https://apamacommunity.com/downloads/)
including Software AG Designer on a laptop or PC.
- Docker and the apama-builder and apama-correlator images. See the links below
for more details.

	- https://hub.docker.com/_/softwareag-apama-builder
	- https://hub.docker.com/_/apama-correlator

## Setup and Configuration
### Installing Apama Community Core to the Raspberry Pi
Download the Apama Community Core zip for Arm to the Raspberry Pi. The latest version is available from the [Apama Community Edition Downloads page](https://www.apamacommunity.com/downloads/).

Untar the archive to `/opt/softwareag`:

```
mkdir /opt/softwareag
tar -xzf apama_core_<version>_armv7_linux.tar.gz --directory /opt/softwareag
```

### Installing the Apama Server Script
Clone the thin-edge.io examples GitHub repository to the home directory of the Raspberry Pi:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io_examples.git
```

Run the commands below to copy the Apama service script, make it exectuable and
install it.
```
sudo cp thin-edge.io_examples/StreamingAnalytics/src/service/apama /etc/init.d
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/apama
sudo service apama start
```

This service starts a correlator with the project located in
`/etc/tedge/apama/project`. If no project exists in that location, the script
exits without starting the correlator, as it will in this instance.

To set up the service to run on startup, run the command:
```
sudo /sbin/update-rc.d apama defaults 80
```

## Quick Start
For demonstration purposes a simple project has been provided with this repository which listens 
for events on the `demo/number` MQTT topic, increments the number by 1, and sends it back to the 
`tedge/measurements` topic.

Copy the project located in the `StreamingAnalytics/src` directory of this repository to the 
`/etc/tedge/apama/project` directory on the Raspberry Pi:

```
sudo cp -r thin-edge.io_examples/StreamingAnalytics/src/quickstart/project /etc/tedge/apama
```
Now skip to the [launching instructions](#launching-a-project) to launch the project.

## Creating a Software AG Designer Project
### Creating a New Project
- Open Software AG Designer on the laptop or PC and select a workspace (the default location is fine).
- Start a new project by choosing __File → New → Apama Project__.
- Give your project a name and then click __Next__.
- Add the MQTT connectivity plug-in from 'Connectivity bundles' and JSON support from 'Standard 
bundles' to the project and then click the __Finish__ button.

### Configuring MQTT Support
Open the `MQTT.properties` file.  This contains the configurations relating to the MQTT broker. 
thin-edge.io uses Mosquitto as the MQTT broker which runs on the same host as the Apama 
project.  The thin-edge.io Mosquitto broker is configured to not require SSL/TLS or password 
authentication for internal traffic. 

>In the Project Explorer tab, configuration files for MQTT can be found under __config → 
connectivity → MQTT__. ![The project explorer tab](src/images/proj-explorer.png)

The `MQTT_brokerURL` should be set as below:
```
MQTT_brokerURL=localhost
```
A full example of `MQTT.properties` can be found [here](src/quickstart/project/config/connectivity/MQTT/MQTT.properties).

>Unless manually configured otherwise, the thin-edge.io MQTT broker operates on the default 
port 1883.

Open the `MQTT.yaml` file.  This contains configuration relating to the chain which maps the MQTT 
messages to EPL events.

MQTT messages need to be mapped to EPL events in order to be able to use them within Apama.  The 
easiest way to do this for this purpose is using the 
[Classifier codec](https://www.apamacommunity.com/documents/10.11.0.1/apama_10.11.0.1_webhelp/apama-webhelp/#page/apama-webhelp%2Fco-ConApaAppToExtCom_classifier_codec.html%23wwconnect_header) 
which inspects incoming events on the transport and classify them, usually to an EPL event 
type, based upon their payload and metadata.  

An example `MQTT.yaml` file which contains the mapping for a single event with a single member can 
be found [here](src/quickstart/project/config/connectivity/MQTT/MQTT.yaml), more examples can be 
found within the other Streaming Analytics sample projects in this repository.

### Writing Apama Projects

The quick start example (see [Quick Start](#quick-start)) and the samples in this directory show 
some examples of EPL for some basic use cases.  The full EPL reference can be found 
[here](https://www.apamacommunity.com/documents/10.11.0.1/apama_10.11.0.1_webhelp/ApamaDoc/index.html).


### Deploying a Project
To deploy a project, use the `engine_deploy` utility provided with Apama.  Navigate to the 
workspace directory in a command prompt/terminal and run the following command in an `apama_env` 
prompt (see ['Setting up the environment using the Apama command prompt'](https://www.apamacommunity.com/documents/10.11.0.1/apama_10.11.0.1_webhelp/apama-webhelp/#page/apama-webhelp%2Fco-DepAndManApaApp_setting_up_the_environment_using_the_apama_command_prompt.html)):
```
engine_deploy --outputDeployDir project <project-src-dir>
```
Copy the contents of the `project` directory created by the above command to
the `/etc/tedge/apama/project` directory on the Raspberry Pi.

## Launching a Project
Use the command below to start the service. The restart function first 
checks to see if the project is already running and attempts to perform a graceful shutdown of 
the correlator if it is.  It then starts a new correlator with the project located in 
`/etc/tedge/apama/project`.

```
sudo service apama restart
```

>If you update or replace the project in `/etc/tedge/apama/project`, you need to restart 
the service again to load the new configuration.

## Testing a Project
To publish messages to MQTT, thin-edge.io has a [built-in command](https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/blob/main/docs/src/howto-guides/005_pub_sub.md).
You can publish/subscribe to any MQTT topic using this command, not just
thin-edge.io specific ones.  The messages should be valid [Thin Edge JSON](https://github.com/thin-edge/thin-edge.io/blob/main/docs/src/architecture/thin-edge-json.md)
format.

To test the quick start example, first open a terminal to subscribe to the `tedge/measurements` 
topic:

``` 
tedge mqtt sub tedge/measurements
```
In a separate terminal send some messages formatted like below:
```
tedge mqtt pub 'demo/number' '{ "number": 3 }'
```

The output numbers in the `tedge/measurements` topic should be the original test values 
incremented by 1.

If you followed the recommended prerequisite of connecting thin-edge.io to a
cloud provider such as Cumulocity IoT or Azure IoT Hub, any valid
(Thin Edge JSON) messages published to `tedge/measurements` also appear in the
device measurement interface.
