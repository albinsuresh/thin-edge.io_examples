# Streaming Analytics Limited Bandwidth Sample

This example shows how Apama can be used on a thin-edge device to process and
filter events to reduce the frequency of messages sent to the cloud.

The EPL file in this sample
([ThinEdgeIoExample.mon](project/monitors/ThinEdgeIoExample.mon)) collates
temperature, pressure and vibration events, averages them and sends a
measurement combining those averages at 5 second intervals to thin-edge.io via
MQTT.

## Prerequisites
Follow the setup and configuration instructions in the [README](../README.md)
file in the parent directory before running this sample.

Ensure that the thin-edge device has Python 3 installed, that it is on your
`$path`, and that you have installed `paho-mqtt`:
```
sudo apt-get install python3
pip install paho-mqtt
```

## How to run the sample

> Note: If you intend to modify or extend this sample it is recommended that
> you delete the provided [config.yaml](./project/config.yaml) file and use
> `engine_deploy` from a full Apama installation to build a deployable version
> of your project which you then copy to the thin-edge device. This is because
> changing this sample could break the configuration in
> [config.yaml](./project/config.yaml) and using `engine_deploy` works out the
> correct initialization order when creating a deployable project.

1. Copy the contents of the [project](./project) directory to the
`/etc/tedge/apama/project` directory on the thin-edge device.
2. On the thin-edge device, restart the service with `sudo service apama
restart`. This restarts the correlator and runs the project that was copied
in the previous step.
3. Execute the `demo_publisher.py` script in this directory to send some fake
temperature, pressure and vibration measurements to the Apama application.
4. If you have configured thin-edge.io to connect to Cumulocity IoT or another
cloud service you should see the measurement(s) appear there.
Otherwise, run `tail /var/log/apama/correlator.log` to print out the end of
the correlator log file. In the correlator's output you should see log messages
indicating that the combined measurement has been sent to `tedge/measurements`.

> _Note:_ The actual path to the correlator log file is
> determined by the project's configuration or the `--logfile` argument passed
> to the correlator in the [Apama service script](../src/service/apama).

> _Caution:_ The correlator fails to start if you specify the name of the
> logfile in both the project configuration and the `--logfile` argument to
> the correlator.
